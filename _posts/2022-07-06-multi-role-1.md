# What

This is a Proof-Of-Concept (POC) of using multiple database roles with
Hasura.

<a id="orgc63b489"></a>

# Why

Databases like PostgreSQL have a rich set of features that rely on the
ability to use multiple different database roles. In order to take
advantage of those features, Hasura would have to allow databases to
be added and configured with multiple database roles.  In order to be
really useful, it would also have to offer a way to dispatch to
database connections on different roles, based on runtime parameters
such as HTTP headers and perhaps other factors as well.  Since Hasura
does not currently support this, this POC was developed to illustrate
an alternative approach to using multiple database roles.

# How

The approach this POC takes is to set up a Hasura graphql-engine
server for each database role, and then to use a reverse proxy / load
balancer to dispatch to those servers at runtime based on an HTTP
header in incoming GraphQL requests.  It uses [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as the load
balancer so that it provides the API endpoint, with the graphql-engine
servers acting as back-ends.

# Steps

### Launch Services

Use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to launch:

-   1 PostgreSQL 14 database
-   5 Hasura graphql-engine servers
-   1 nginx load-balancer

The database setup includes scripts in `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`
that set up a simple data model with tables for `account`, `order`,
`order_detail`, `product`, and `region`, to insert sample data into
those tables, to set up 5 additional database roles `hasurauser_1`
through `hasurauser_5`, and to set up [Row Security Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) on the
`account`, `order`, and `order_detail` tables.  The rows those three
tables are distributed randomly accross roles `hasurauser_1` through
`hasurause_4` while `hasurauser_5` has none, according to a `manager`
field on each of those tables.    

    docker-compose up -d

### Generate .env Files

As there are 5 graphql-engine back-ends listening on 5 mapped ports
8081 through 8085, it is convenient to configure their endoints and
admin secrets in local `.env` files.  These are generated using the
Bash script `setup.bash`.

    bash setup.bash

### Apply Metadata

The 5 graphql-engine back-ends are configured with the same metadata.
Ultimately, that metadata is stored in the shared PostgreSQL
database.  At initialization, however, that metadata has not yet been
loaded into any of the servers or into the database, and is only in
the metadata files on disk in this repository.  Use the Hasura CLI to
`apply` the metadata to one of these servers.  That will suffice to
load the metadata not only into that server but also into the shared
database.  Consequently, it is only needed to `reload` the metadata
for the other 4 servers.

    cd hasura
    hasura --envfile local1.env metadata apply
    hasura --envfile local2.env metadata reload
    hasura --envfile local3.env metadata reload
    hasura --envfile local4.env metadata reload
    hasura --envfile local5.env metadata reload
