title: Multiple DB Roles in Hasura (Part I)

This Proof-Of-Concept (POC) uses multiple database roles with Hasura.
A single Hasura instance can only use one database role, which
forecloses using certain database features like Row Level Security
(RLS).  This POC works around this limitation with multiple Hasura
instances and a proxy.

[GitHub Project](https://github.com/dventimiglia/hasura-projects/tree/master/multi-role-1 "GitHub Project")

Databases like PostgreSQL have a rich set of features that rely on the
ability to use multiple different database roles. In order to take
advantage of those features, Hasura would have to allow databases to
be added and configured with multiple database roles.  In order to be
really useful, it would also have to offer a way to dispatch to
database connections on different roles, based on runtime parameters
such as HTTP headers and perhaps other factors as well.  Since Hasura
does not currently support this, this POC was developed to illustrate
an alternative approach to using multiple database roles.

The approach this Proof-Of-Concept (POC) takes is to set up a Hasura
graphql-engine server for each database role, and then to use a
reverse proxy / load balancer to dispatch to those servers at runtime
based on an HTTP header in incoming GraphQL requests.  It uses [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
as the load balancer so that it provides the API endpoint, with the
graphql-engine servers acting as back-ends.

Use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to launch:

-   1 PostgreSQL 14 database
-   5 Hasura graphql-engine servers
-   1 nginx load-balancer

The database setup includes scripts in `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`
that set up a simple data model with tables for `account`, `order`,
`order_detail`, `product`, and `region`, to insert sample data into
those tables, to set up 5 additional database roles `hasurauser_1`
through `hasurauser_5`, and to set up [Row Security Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) on the
`account`, `order`, and `order_detail` tables.  The rows those three
tables are distributed randomly accross roles `hasurauser_1` through
`hasurause_4` while `hasurauser_5` has none, according to a `manager`
field on each of those tables.    

As there are 5 graphql-engine back-ends listening on 5 mapped ports
8081 through 8085, it is convenient to configure their endoints and
admin secrets in a local `.env` file.  This can be generated in the
following way.  Naturally, take care to change the ports to ones that
are available on your system.

```bash
cat <<EOF > .env
PGPORT=5433
NGINXPORT=8080
HGEPORT1=8081
HGEPORT2=8082
HGEPORT3=8083
HGEPORT4=8084
HGEPORT5=8085
EOF
```

Next we examine the Docker Compose file, which is presented here.

This `docker-compose.yaml` file has the following features

  * service `postgres` :: PostgreSQL 16 for both Hasura data and metadata
  * services `graphql-engine-1` through `graphql-engine-5` :: 5 Hasura
    instances each connecting to `postgres` with a different role
    `hasurauser_1` through `hasurauser_5`.
  * Hasura [Auto-Apply Migrations and Metadata](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/migrations-metadata-seeds/auto-apply-migrations/ "Auto-Apply Migrations and Metadata") :: track the same set of database objects in every Hasura instance
  * service `proxy` :: nginx server routing to `graphql-engine-1` through `graphql-engine-5` based on the `x-database-role` header
  
Here's the `nginx.conf` file that sets up the proxy.

```

The POC and its services can be launched locally using Docker Compose with this command.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

It sets up a simple toy online retail data model for a grocery store, with these tables and functions.

  * `account` :: table for account holders
  * `product` :: table for grocery items that can be ordered by account holders
  * `order` :: table for an event that records an account holder requesting to purchase some number of products
  * `order_detail` :: table for a line-item entry for an order listing the product and its quantity
  * `region` :: table for the sales region for an order
  * `product_search` :: function for full-text search across products
  * `product_search_slow` :: same as `product_search` but with a timer (to illustrate timeouts)
  
The data model also comes equipped sample data for these tables,
including randomly synthesized orders.  Finally, it also includes Row
Access Policies that do the following.

  * assign a `manager` to each account
  * associate a `manager` with database roles `hasura_1` through
    `hasura_5`
  * policies limit access based on the manager
  
Our goal is to submit GraphQL queries, specifiying the `manager` via
an `x-database-role` Header, have that header value be used to select
the corresponding database role, and have the Row Access Policies
limit the query results according to their rules and the requesting
database role.

We can test that with queries like these.  First, we request accounts
with `x-database-role` set to `hasurauser_1`.  There are exactly 1000
accounts overall, but as we see, the actual number that are returned
is less than that according to the value of the `manager`.  The data
are random so the exact counts will vary, but each manager
`hasurauser_1` through `hasurauser_4` has approximately one quarter of
the total, as they should.

```bash
curl \
    -s \
    'http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql' \
    -H 'x-database-role: hasurauser_1' \
    --data '{"query":"query MyQuery {account_aggregate {aggregate {count}}}","variables":{}}' | jq -r '.'

{
  "data": {
    "account_aggregate": {
      "aggregate": {
        "count": 249
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
curl \
    -s \
    'http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql' \
    -H 'x-database-role: hasurauser_2' \
    --data '{"query":"query MyQuery {account_aggregate {aggregate {count}}}","variables":{}}' | jq -r '.'

{
  "data": {
    "account_aggregate": {
      "aggregate": {
        "count": 249
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
curl \
    -s \
    'http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql' \
    -H 'x-database-role: hasurauser_3' \
    --data '{"query":"query MyQuery {account_aggregate {aggregate {count}}}","variables":{}}' | jq -r '.'

{
  "data": {
    "account_aggregate": {
      "aggregate": {
        "count": 245
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
curl \
    -s \
    'http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql' \
    -H 'x-database-role: hasurauser_4' \
    --data '{"query":"query MyQuery {account_aggregate {aggregate {count}}}","variables":{}}' | jq -r '.'

{
  "data": {
    "account_aggregate": {
      "aggregate": {
        "count": 257
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Meanwhile, the manager `hasurauser_5` has no accounts as it is
deliberately arranged that no accounts be assigned to this manager.

```bash
curl \
    -s \
    'http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql' \
    -H 'x-database-role: hasurauser_5' \
    --data '{"query":"query MyQuery {account_aggregate {aggregate {count}}}","variables":{}}' | jq -r '.'

{
  "data": {
    "account_aggregate": {
      "aggregate": {
        "count": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All of these results are making use of database Row Access Policies
and do not rely either on explicit query filters or even Hasura
Authorization.

Hasura Authorization is a powerful feature, but often there will be
good reasons for eschewing it in favor of data governance and other
functions that are offered *in situ* in the database.  Heretofore,
this has been impossible to achieve with Hasura.  This POC offers a
workaround to expand the range of Hasura's uses to include accessing
these advanced database features.
