<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mesh">Data Mesh</a> is a decentralized data architecture&#x2013;itself a subcategory
of software architecture&#x2013;designed to enable businesses to become more
data-driven.

<h2 id="org5911290"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> History</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Data Mesh was largely invented in 2019 by Zhamak Dehghani, who was at
"Director of emerging technologies" at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtworks">ThoughtWorks</a>.  ThoughtWorks is
an influential technology company whose "Chief Scientist" Martin
Fowler helped mint another "big idea" in
software--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile-Development</a>&#x2013;2001.  Agile was a re-branding of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme-Programming</a> (XP) after Microsoft Windows XP was released
in 2001.  XP begat Agile which was also framed as a set of guiding
"principles" but stripped of XP's implementation details.  While Data
Mesh is more of a younger sibling to rather than a descendant of
Agile, it too is framed in the same ThoughtWorks "house style" as a
set of vague.  Data Mesh <i>is also</i> a descendant of Domain Driven
Design (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a>), created by software design consultant Eric Evans
in 2003.  Like Data Mesh, DDD also recommends decentralization, though
more in the organization of software teams and their processes rather
than in the software product itself.
</p>

<p>
Alongside this history of software design theory is a history of
software design actuality, especially in the design of data systems.
A good candidate for marking the beginning of the recent history of
data systems is the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud Computing</a> circa 2010.
Cloud Computing and commodity hardware accelerated the downward trend
on infrastructure costs, lowering the cost of generating and storing
data.  Smartphones and ad networks readily exploited the added
capacity, but computing sums and averages over Big Data exceeded the
abilities of previous-generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse">Data-Warehouses</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mart">Data-Marts</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cube">Data-Cubes</a>.  Specialized scale-out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> software/hardware solutions
like Apache <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop">Hadoop</a> and Apache <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark">Spark</a> stepped into the gap until the
first general-purpose scale-out SQL software solutions AWS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Redshift">Redshift</a>
and Google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery">BigQuery</a> became usable 5 years later.  All these factors
preserved and even intensified the existing bias toward centralization
in data systems, and all these factors were driven and determined by
technology.  From the previous generation of vertically-scaled Data
Warehouses to the current generation of horizontally-scaled Data
Warehouses to the Extract-Translate-Load (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>) pipelines to feed them
to the Hadoop and Spark batch job analytics, these were specialized
technologies demanding skill specialization and consequently
centralization.
</p>

<p>
The trend toward centralization continues, but the demand for
specialization has relaxed as the data technology has evolved.
Products like AWS Redshift <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c-using-spectrum.html">Spectrum</a> and AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/presto/">Athena</a> thoroughly
separated compute and storage, offered a SQL interface over
heterogeneous data in object stores, relaxed the demand for
Transformation (the "T" in "ETL"), and encouraged the dumping of raw
data into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake">Data Lakes</a> in AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob
Storage.  Next-generation Data Warehouses like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_Inc.">Snowflake</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickHouse">ClickHouse</a> continued this trend by removing the need for specialized
Data Warehouse schema designs altogether.
</p>

<p>
Specialization, however, is just one of the forces that drove toward
centralization.  There are others: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance">Data-Governance</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_steward">Data Stewardship</a>,
and the lingering technological impediments to any alternative.  This
brings us to 2019 and sets the stage for the Data Mesh.
</p>

<p>
What Zhamak Dehghani did in 2019 with Data Mesh was to identify
countervailing forces driving toward decentralization, articulate
those as threads and weave them into a narrative, connect this
narrative to previous "big ideas" like DDD and microservices, urge
practitioners to overcome the impediments involving Data Governance,
Data Stewardship, etc., distill a set of guiding principles, and brand
the whole package under an imaginative new term, "Data Mesh."  What
was left out were concrete implementation details and actionable
advice on how actually to <i>obtain</i> a Data Mesh.  <i>This</i> brings us to
2024 and sets the stage for the current State of the (Data) Mesh

<h2 id="org1017e67"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The State of the Mesh</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Let's evaluate the current state of the Data Mesh with respect to our
summary above and to the guiding principles that Zhamak Dehghani first
articulated in 2019.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Data Mesh" is a decentralized data architecture&#x2013;itself a subcategory
of software architecture&#x2013;designed to enable businesses to become more
data-driven.
</p>
</blockquote>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Domain Ownership</dt><dd>Divide the data architecture into components
according to the business units and assign responsibility for those
components to those business units.</dd>
<dt>Data as a product</dt><dd>Assign elevated responsibility to those
business units over their data components, requiring them to offer
the same level of quality to the data as they would to any product.</dd>
<dt>Self-serve data platform</dt><dd>Provide those business units with
software and hardware infrastructure, which enables them to meet
their elevated responsibility.</dd>
<dt>Federated computational governance</dt><dd>Foster collaboration so that
the responsibility to comply with governance policies can be
optimally shared between those business units and a central
authority.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
A necessary if not sufficient condition to make Data Mesh a reality is
"Self-serve data platform".  This can be analyzed along two
dimensions:  what the data is, and how the data is served.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgab2f777" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgab2f777"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Data typically falls into two broad categories: operational and
analytical.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Operational Data</dt><dd>traditional On-Line Transaction Processing
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">OLTP</a>) data facilitating ongoing business functions, demanding
low-latency and high-recency, allowing low volume, and comprising a
mix of read and write operations</dd>
<dt>Analytical Data</dt><dd>traditional On-Line Analytical Processing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">OLAP</a>)
data for decision-support, demanding high-volume, allowing
high-latency and low-recency, and comprising exclusively read
operations</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org260b9bd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org260b9bd"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Serving</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Serving typically is performed in one of two ways:  with a query
language, or with an Application Programming Interface (API)
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Query Language</dt><dd>general-purpose highly-flexible high-expressivity
language to represent the full intent of ad-hoc data requests in a
single operation usually for OLAP over OLTP and powering
decision-support and Business Intelligence (BI) systems, e.g. SQL</dd>
<dt>API</dt><dd>special-purpose highly-inflexible low-expressivity set of
Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) that each represent a pre-ordained data
request usually for OLTP over OLAP and powering desktop and mobile
applications, e.g. REST</dd>
</dl>

<p>
A Data Mesh may be over operational data, analytical data, or both.
Consequently, a Data Mesh may be powered by a query language, APIs, or
both.  The list of candidate query languages is quite short: SQL,
GraphQL.  The list of candidate API formats is equally short: REST,
GraphQL.  The careful reader will note the presence of GraphQL in both
of these lists; there will be more on that later.
</p>

<p>
To make Data Mesh a reality, three technologies emerge for these
candidates:  Data Catalogs, API Gateways, and Distributed Query
Engines. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orged267fd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orged267fd"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> Data Catalogs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Data Catalogs such a <a href="https://atlan.com/">Atlan</a>, <a href="https://www.collibra.com/">Collibra</a>, and <a href="https://www.amundsen.io/">Amundsen</a> do abide by some of
the four guiding principles listed above: Domain Ownership, Data as a
Product, and Federated Computational Governance.  Where they tend to
fall down is in the fourth principle, Self-service Data Platform.  A few
of them&#x2013;notably <a href="https://www.alation.com/">Alation</a> and <a href="https://open-metadata.org/">OpenMetadata</a>&#x2013;do offer a limited
Self-serve Data Platform using pass-through SQL.  However, they
generally lack the ability to blend and join heterogeneous data from
multiple sources.  
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3881334" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3881334"><span class="section-number-3">3.4.</span> API Gateways</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
API Gateways such as <a href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura</a> and <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/">Apollo Router</a> on the other hand tend
to concentrate on just the one guiding principle:  Self-serve Data
Platform.  Notably, both manage this by settling on GraphQL which, we
recall, is both a query language and an API format.  As a query
language, GraphQL arguably is less powerful than SQL, however its
limitations coupled with its uniformity, its machine-readability, and
its self-describing nature lend GraphQL to a Self-serve Data
Platform over heterogeneous data from multiple sources.  Moreover, in
its dual role as not just a query language but also as an API format,
GraphQL covers not just analytical OLAP data but operational OLTP data
needs as well.  
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb3976ec" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb3976ec"><span class="section-number-3">3.5.</span> Distributed Query Engines</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">
<p>
Not to be overlooked are Distributed Query Engines such as <a href="https://trino.io/">Trino</a> and
<a href="https://prestodb.io/">PrestoDB</a>.  These build on the simpler pass-through SQL of Data
Catalogs like Atlan and OpenMetadata with a much more sophisticated
execution model, adding cross-database joins, predicate push-downs,
and relatively efficient query processing.  Large latencies may limit
their utility for operational data, but they are quite promising for
at least the analytical data workloads of Data Meshes.

<h2 id="orgae2dc6d"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Data Mesh Recipe</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
As of writing in 2024, arguably a real Data Mesh that takes theory
into practice will have to be cobbled together from parts.  Few if any
products currently on the market adequately adhere to all four of the
four guiding principles.  Such a recipe for creating a Data Mesh would
include these components.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Data Catalog</dt><dd>Domain Ownership, Data as a Product, and Federated
Computational Governance require a vast suite of services which so
far only Data Catalogs have offered in earnest:  lineage,
provenance, quality metrics, documentation, collaboration.
Consequently, a Data Catalog is probably a non-optional piece of
your Data Mesh recipe.</dd>
<dt>API Gateway</dt><dd>If operational data workloads are at all among the
Data Mesh workloads, an API Gateway is almost a "must-have."  There
are few options here and they all use GraphQL, so this necessitates
GraphQL being present in your Data Mesh recipe.  The two leading
options&#x2013;Hasura and Apollo Router&#x2013;actually work well together,
however only Hasura is really set up for adapting existing data
sources with GraphQL.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
A Distributed Query Engine like Trino or Presto of course is an option
to augment the Data Mesh's Self-serve Data Platform at the cost of
additional operational complexity.

<h2 id="org42956f0"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Wrapping Up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Actually building and deploying a Data Mesh from these components is a
tall order that involves details beyond the scope of this introductory
article.  However, hopefully this article has helped to clarify the
history of Data Mesh, position it within one's Data Strategy, dispel
some of the vagueness that rounds Data Mesh, develops a mental model
for reasoning about a Data Mesh, and offers some concrete and
actionable advice to anyone who wishes to take Data Mesh from theory
into practice.
