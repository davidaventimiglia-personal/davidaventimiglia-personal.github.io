GraphQL's <a href="https://youtu.be/783ccP__No8?si=3dbou_uhzBniMzz0">origin story</a> is an old one: Developers at Facebook created
GraphQL in 2012 as part of the social media giant's shift from web to
mobile.  They <i>had</i> a high-performance object-oriented data platform
as a foundation.  They <i>needed</i> a flexible and expressive web API on
top of it to satisfy the needs of nimble mobile developers iterating
rapidly on an inherently dynamic, graph-oriented application.  They
revamped and open sourced it in 2015 to great fanfare, with the
Facebook marketing might behind it.  It got a standard, it got a
standards body, and it got a community.  Along the way, GraphQL's
value proposition settled on a few simple promises.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ask for what you need, get exactly that.</li>
<li>Describe what's possible with a type system.</li>
<li>Move faster with powerful developer tools.</li>
<li>Evolve your API without versions.</li>
<li>Bring your own data and code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And, it <a href="https://hasura.io/resources/graphql-handbook-2024">delivered</a>!  GraphQL is a general-purpose query language,
giving API consumers the ability to ask in a single request for all
the data they need, and nothing more.  It gave API producers the
ability to say in a single response exactly what data they offer and
how.  It gave front-end developers the ability to iterate
independently of back-end developers.  It gave back-end developers the
ability to evolve independently of front-end developers.  It gave
middle-ware developers the ability to help both front-end and back-end
developers without needing to consult with either.  And, it gave
architects and data governors the ability to fulfill their dreams of
harmonic convergence.  GraphQL had its Technology Trigger and was on
its way up.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcb35457">
<p>
GraphQL may have crested the Peak of Inflated Expectations since then,
but it's reached a broad flat <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fg%2F11cn3w0w9t,GraphQL&amp;hl=en">plateau</a> where the weather is mild and
the terrain is gentle.  There have been laudable successes and no
overt failures.  Needs were met, products were created, wars were
fought, and empires were founded.
</p>

<p>
When plateaus inevitably come to an end, however, pioneers have to
plan a difficult descent and journey beyond.  The bloom is off the
GraphQL rose and not all is a bed of roses.  Discontentment rises and
disillusionment beckons, and the tools and tricks that got us here may
not work for what lies ahead.

<p>
Rumors of GraphQL's demise are greatly exaggerated.  GraphQL is far
from extinct, but what environmental conditions threaten its path to
flourishing?  An emerging <a href="https://bessey.dev/blog/2024/05/24/why-im-over-graphql/">consensus</a> groups the various grumblings
about GraphQL into three main complaints.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Security</dt><dd>GraphQL exposes public APIs to exfiltration, tampering,
and denial-of-service from bad actors.</dd>
<dt>Performance</dt><dd>GraphQL exposes all APIs to bad performance even from
friendly actors.</dd>
<dt>Complexity</dt><dd>GraphQL exposes developers&#x2013;especially back-end
developers&#x2013;to enormous complexity.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In short, if GraphQL APIs are a dream to <i>use</i>, they're a nightmare to
<i>create</i>, especially if security and performance needs are to be met.
GraphQL's critics have valid points.  Addressing those points and
leading it out of a dark wood may require rethinking GraphQL from the
ground up.

What is GraphQL and how is it implemented?  The GraphQL Foundation
answers those questions in this way:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
GraphQL is a query language for your API&#x2026;[and] is created by
&#x2026;providing functions for each field on each type.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's time to rethink both parts of that answer.

<div id="outline-container-org313549b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org313549b">Rethinking What GraphQL Is</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org313549b">
<p>
GraphQL is not <i>necessarily</i> a "query language for your API".  Public
and partner APIs don't control or even know their clients, can't
control or even anticipate usage patterns, and therefore would benefit
from a flexible query language, and yet there are <a href="https://xuorig.medium.com/why-we-dont-see-many-public-graphql-apis-ad972bcb201e">few</a> public and
partner GraphQL APIs.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that the security
criticisms of GraphQL listed above constitute the main barrier to
GraphQL adoption for public APIs.  While there do exist GraphQL
<a href="https://hasura.io/security/">security measures</a> that can blunt attacks, we should remember that the
market for public APIs may be small and may be getting smaller as
enthusiasm for public and even partner APIs <a href="https://youtu.be/BxV14h0kFs0?si=y2a4uhr9Z9X95dXm">wanes</a>.  That leaves
private APIs.  Yet private APIs typically <i>own</i> their clients, <i>know</i>
their usage patterns, and don't <i>need</i> a flexible query language.  So,
what then even <i>is</i> GraphQL in this setting?
</p>

<p>
GraphQL is a <i>development tool</i>.  An emerging rebuttal to the
criticisms of GraphQL listed above is to use persisted queries,
<a href="https://hasura.io/docs/latest/security/allow-list/">allow-lists</a>, and <a href="https://hasura.io/docs/latest/restified/overview/">RESTified-endpoints</a>.  That blunts the security
criticism against GraphQL APIs largely by <i>removing</i> GraphQL APIs and
substituting them with good old-fashioned REST.  GraphQL becomes a way
to <i>define</i> API endpoints.  It's an alternative to defining API
endpoints in code, but code is a development tool, so then what <i>is</i>
GraphQL but a development tool?  If GraphQL is a development tool,
then what are its benefits (and its drawbacks)?
</p>

<p>
The benefits of GraphQL over code as a development tool for defining
API endpoints accrue to its original strengths: flexibility,
efficiency, and discoverability.  GraphQL is a <i>lingua-franca</i>, a
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html">ubiquitous-language</a> to mediate conversations among front-end
developers, back-end developers, data modelers, and product owners,
but it's also an <i>implementation</i> language for the outcome of those
conversations.  It covers 80% of what code is being asked to do when
building APIs&#x2013;data marshaling&#x2013;better
than code can do it.
</p>

<p>
The drawbacks of GraphQL over code as a development tool for defining
API endpoints lie in that remaining 20%:  "business-logic".  API
server code is a convenient if far from ideal arena for implementing
business logic.  Business logic&#x2013;unlike data marshaling&#x2013;really does
benefit from the power of code, and if you're using code to write your
API server, you might as well just use the same code to implement the
business logic right in the API server.  Never mind that this mixes
concerns and leads to tight coupling, it at least has the virtue of
being obvious.  But, these drawbacks can be overcome by building a
GraphQL server that has no intrinsic business logic, but instead offers
channels for injecting business logic:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><a href="https://hasura.io/docs/latest/schema/postgres/input-validations/">input-validation</a></dt><dd>synchronous RPC into the language of your choice
for the simple but common case of validating input data</dd>
<dt><a href="https://hasura.io/docs/latest/actions/overview/">remote-actions</a></dt><dd>synchronous RPC into the language of your choice
for the less simple but less common general business-logic case</dd>
<dt><a href="https://hasura.io/docs/latest/event-triggers/overview/">event-triggers</a></dt><dd>asynchronous event processor in the language of
your choice for the common case of exhibiting side-effects</dd>
<dt><a href="https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authorization/index/">authorization</a></dt><dd>elegant strategy for the common but thorny problem
of access control</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Not only do these features equal the "obvious" strategy for
business-logic of writing it right into the server code, they exceed
it by freeing it from the language of the server and by separating it
from the concerns of the server.
</p>

<p>
Rethinking what GraphQL is by thinking of it as a development tool
frees us from a major impediment to GraphQL's progress into the
future.  The other major impediment is removed as we will see by
rethinking how GraphQL is implemented.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3fbaf76">
<p>
GraphQL need not <i>necessarily</i> be implemented by "providing functions
for each field on each type."  Those functions are typically called
resolvers.  They are units of composition in how servers typically
execute GraphQL operations.  Their granularity and composability
fulfill the promise of GraphQL flexibility.  Yet they also are to
blame for the performance criticisms of GraphQL listed above.  Not all
servers GraphQL or otherwise are over SQL databases, but many are, and
if we use SQL databases as a representative case, the granularity and
composability of resolvers also gives rise to the N+1 Problem: a query
graph whose node number grows exponentially with every level leads to
a call graph whose resolver function calls grow exponentially, which
leads to a batch of SQL statements that grows exponentially.  Never
mind that the retrieved data volume also grows exponentially with
every level, which imposes a natural limit on how far this can go,
this is still a problem.  And yet the leading solution to this
problem&#x2013;the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/dataloader">data-loader</a> pattern&#x2013;only diminishes the problem without
banishing it, sacrifices much of GraphQL's flexibility, and
contributes to the complexity which is the third criticism listed
above.  Confronted with this Gordian knot, it's worth asking another
foundational question.  Can we implement GraphQL in some <i>other</i> way,
and if so, how?
</p>

<p>
GraphQL can be implemented with a <i><a href="https://hasura.io/blog/compile-dont-resolve-designing-a-feature-rich-high-performance-domain-driven-graphql-api">compiler</a></i>.  GraphQL is a
general-purpose query language which often (if not always) is over
data that ultimately comes from database engines with their own
general-purpose query languages.  If those engines happen to process
their queries with a network of operators that bear more than a
passing resemblance to resolvers, that's their business.  All <i>we</i>
have to do is compile (or translate, or transpile) our query into
theirs and let them handle the rest.  <a href="https://exograph.dev/blog/graphql-better-with-exograph#data-fetching-and-the-n1-problem">Some</a> <a href="https://grafast.org/grafast/#plan-resolvers">people</a> in the GraphQL
community are finally getting around to this idea.  <a href="https://www.graphile.org/">Some</a> <a href="https://hasura.io/">of us</a> have
been here all along.
</p>

<p>
The benefits of a compiler approach to GraphQL are many.  It
<i>eliminates</i> the N+1 problem.  It paves the way for a powerful
strategy for implementing <a href="https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authorization/index/">authorization</a> as discussed above.  And, by
generating the GraphQL schema from the database schema, it eliminates
tedious repetitive boilerplate data modeling that serves high-minded
ideals that are impractical <a href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=database+with+thousands+of+tables">at scale</a>.
</p>

<p>
The drawbacks of a compiler approach to GraphQL are legendary, but in
that word's first meaning rather than its second: <i>"of, relating to,
or characteristic of legend or a legend"</i>, i.e. folklore.  The fear is
that by generating the GraphQL schema from the database schema, the
database is exposed and the data modeler's hands are tied.  That would
be a problem if it were true, but it isn't.  The GraphQL schema can be
curated as much or as little as needed via SQL views, SQL functions,
and <a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/smart-tags/">affordances</a> and <a href="https://hasura.io/docs/latest/schema/postgres/tables/#tracking-tables">configurations</a> within the GraphQL server.
Moreover, the proposed alternative isn't as different as one might
think.  Deliberately, thoughtfully, lovingly "designing" a GraphQL
data model by meticulously writing resolvers is just making the same
choices in code as we recommend through configuration, albeit by
taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Way_Round">long way around</a>.
</p>

<p>
Rethinking how GraphQL is implemented by thinking of it as a
<i>compiler</i> opens up new strategies for addressing old problems.  It
may not be possible in every case.  In Facebook's OG use-case for
creating GraphQL, it had a high-performance object-based data model
many layers of abstraction away from any databases.  That's a blessing
and a curse.  There may be no query language to compile to, but on the
other hand you can string together resolvers to your heart's content
and sleep easy at night knowing the high-performance object-based data
model's vast reserves of optimized performance will absorb or
neutralize any N+1 performance problems thrown at it.  For the rest of
us with our puny SQL databases?  Let's just generate our GraphQL
schema, compile our GraphQL queries, and call it a day.

GraphQL is far from dead but it <i>is</i> entering a threatening woods
prowled by three wolves:  <b>security</b>, <b>performance</b>, <b>complexity</b>.
The good news is there's a strategy for getting out of the woods:
rethink what GraphQL <i>is</i> and rethink how GraphQL is <i>implemented</i>.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>GraphQL is a <i>development</i> tool.</dt><dd>Benefit from GraphQL's promises
of independence and nimbleness without sacrificing <b>security</b>, by
using GraphQL to develop API endpoints.</dd>
<dt>GraphQL is implemented with a <i>compiler</i>.</dt><dd>Benefit from GraphQL's
promises of efficiency and type safety without sacrificing
<b>performance</b> and without confronting <b>complexity</b>, by implementing
GraphQL with a compiler for the underlying data platform's native
query interface.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Not every use-case can be satisfied just with API endpoints, and not
every use-case has the luxury of an underlying data platform with a
native query interface, of course, but many do. Moreover, they're
often the ones most exposed to the perceived problems of security,
performance, and complexity.
</p>

<p>
Life is about trade-offs.  Choices have to be made.  GraphQL has a
choice to live or die, but it won't be made without trade-offs.
Cherished ideas about what GraphQL is and how it should be implemented
may have to concede to a changing reality.  The old ways of thinking
about GraphQL may <i>have</i> to die, to give life to new ways of thinking
that allow GraphQL to flourish.
