<h2 id="org44089c0">What is GraphQL and why do people want it?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org44089c0">
<p>
GraphQL is an important evolution in the design of Application
Performance Interfaces (API), but even today it can be difficult to
know how to get started with GraphQL, how to move beyond "Getting
Started" with GraphQL, and how to move beyond the conventional wisdom
on GraphQL.  This is especially true for Java.  This guide attempts to
cover all these bases in three steps.  First, I'll tell you what
GraphQL is, and as a bonus I'll tell you what GraphQL <i>really</i> is.
Second, I'll show you how to implement state-of-the-art GraphQL in
Java for a real application.  Third, I'll offer you an alternative
path beyond the state-of-the-art that may suit your needs better in
every dimension.  And, if you feel like skipping to <a href="#orge86cd9c">the end</a>, who am I
to stop you?  It certainly will save a great deal of effort.
</p>

<p>
So, what <i>is</i> GraphQL?  Well, GraphQL.org <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/">says</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime
for executing queries using a type system you define for your
data. GraphQL isn’t tied to any specific database or storage engine
and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's not wrong, but let me take a few more runs at it from different
directions.  Sure, GraphQL <i>is</i> "a query language for your API", but
you might as well just say that it <i>is</i> an API, or a way of building
an API.  That puts it in contrast with <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/rest-explained/">REST</a>, which GraphQL is an
evolution from and an alternative to.  GraphQL offers several
improvements over REST (or at least, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_Maturity_Model#Level_2:_HTTP_verbs">way</a> that REST is usually
done):
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>expressivity</dt><dd>A client can say exactly what data they need from a
server, no more and no less.</dd>
<dt>efficiency</dt><dd>Expressivity leads to efficiency gains, reducing
network chatter and wasted bandwidth.</dd>
<dt>discoverability</dt><dd>In order to know what to say to a server, a
client needs to know what <i>can</i> be said to a server.  That's where
discoverability comes in, allowing data consumers to know exactly
what's available from data producers.</dd>
<dt>simplicity</dt><dd>GraphQL puts clients in the driver's seat, so there
had better be some good ergonomics for driving.  GraphQL's
highly-regular machine-readable syntax, simple execution model, and
simple <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/">specification</a> lend themselves to inter-operable and composable
tools:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://altairgraphql.dev/">query</a> <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql#readme">tools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive">schema registries</a></li>
<li><a href="https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh">gateways</a></li>
<li><a href="https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen">code generators</a></li>
<li><a href="https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/urql/">client</a> <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/">libraries</a></li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>

<p>
But, what <i>else</i> is GraphQL.  What <i>really</i> is GraphQL?  GraphQL is
<i>also</i> a data model for its query language and, despite the name,
neither the query language nor the data model are very "graphy."  The
data model is <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-JSON-Serialization">essentially</a> just JSON.  The query language <i>looks</i> like
JSON and can be boiled down to a few simple features:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>types</dt><dd>A <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Types">type</a> is a simple value (a <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Scalars">scalar</a>) or a set of fields (an
<a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Objects">object</a>).  While you naturally introduce new types for your own
problem domain, there are few special types (called <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Language.Operations">Operations</a>).
One of theses is <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Query">Query</a>, which is the root of requests for data
(setting aside <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Subscription">Subscription</a> for now, for the sake of simplicity).  A
type essentially is a set of rules for determining if a piece of
data&#x2013;or a request for that piece of data&#x2013;validly conforms to the
given type.  A GraphQL type is very much like a user-defined type in
programming languages like C++, Java, and Typescript, and is very
much like a table in a relational database.</dd>
<dt>field</dt><dd>A field within <i>one</i> type contains one or more pieces of
data that validly conform to <i>another</i> type, thus establishing
<i>relationships</i> among types.  A GraphQL field is very much like a
property of a user-defined type in a programming language, and is
very much like a column in a relational database.  Relationships
between GraphQL types are very much like pointers or references in
programming languages, and are very much like foreign key
constraints in relational databases.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There's more to GraphQL, but that's pretty much the essence.  Note the
similarities between concepts in GraphQL and in programming languages,
and especially between concepts in GraphQL and in relational
databases.  That will be important <a href="#orgd3e9d19">later</a>.
</p>

<p>
OK, that's enough for now about what GraphQL <i>is</i>, but what is GraphQL
<i>for</i>?  Why should we consider GraphQL, especially as an alternative
to REST?  I listed above some of GraphQL's improvements over typical
REST&#x2013;expressivity, efficiency, discoverability, simplicity&#x2013;but
another perhaps more concise way to put it is this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
GraphQL's expressivity, efficiency, discoverability, and simplicity
make life easier for data consumers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, there's a corollary:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
GraphQL's expressivity, efficiency, discoverability, and simplicity
make life harder for data producers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's <i>you</i>!  If you're a Java programmer working with GraphQL, your
job is probably to <i>produce</i> GraphQL API servers for clients to
<i>consume</i> (there are relatively few&#x2013;not "none", but "few"&#x2013;settings
for Java on the client).  Offering all that expressivity,
discoverability, etc. ain't easy, so how do you do it?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org70292c2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org70292c2">How do I provide the GraphQL that people want, especially as a Java developer?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org70292c2">
<p>
On the journey to providing a GraphQL API we confront a series
interdependent choices, which <i>can</i> make life easier (or harder) for
data producers.  One choice is over just <i>how</i> "expressive, efficient,
discoverable, and simple" is our API, but let's set that aside for a
moment and treat that as an emergent property of the other choices we
make.  Life is about trade-offs, after all.
</p>

<p>
Another choice is over <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/e-book/tw_ebook_build_vs_buy_2022.pdf">build-versus-buy [PDF]​</a>, but let's also set that
aside for a moment, accept that we're building a GraphQL API server
(in Java), explore how that is done, and evaluate the consequences.
</p>

<p>
If we're building a GraphQL API server in Java, another choice is over
whether to build it completely from scratch or to use libraries and
frameworks, and if the latter then which libraries and frameworks to
use.  Let's set <i>that</i> aside, rightfully regard a complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">DIY</a>
solution as pointless masochism, and survey the landscape of Java
libraries and frameworks for GraphQL.  As of writing (April 2024)
there are three important interdependent players in this space:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>graphql-java</dt><dd><a href="https://www.graphql-java.com/">graphql-java</a> is a lower-level foundational library
for working with GraphQL in Java, which began in 2015.  Since the
other players depend on and use graphql-java, consider graphql-java
to be <i>non-optional</i>.  Another crucial choice is whether you are or
are not using the <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a> framework.  If you're <i>not</i> using
Spring Boot then <i>stop here!</i> 🛑 Since this is a prerequisite, in
the parlance of the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">ThoughtWorks Radar</a> this is unavoidably <b>Adopt</b>.</dd>
<dt>Netflix DGS</dt><dd><a href="https://netflix.github.io/dgs/">DGS</a> is a higher-level library for working with
GraphQL in Java <i>with Spring Boot</i>, which began in 2021.  If you're
using DGS then you <i>will</i> also be using graphql-java under-the-hood,
but typically you won't come into contact with graphql-java.
Instead, you will be sprinkling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation">annotations</a> throughout the Java code
to identify the code segments (called "resolvers" or "data
fetchers"&#x2026;more on that <a href="#orgd3e9d19">later</a>) that execute GraphQL requests.
Thoughtworks <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/netflix-dgs">said</a> <b>Trial</b> as of 2023 for DGS but this is a dynamic
space and their opinion may have changed.  I say <b>Hold</b>, for reasons
given below.</dd>
<dt>Spring for GraphQL</dt><dd><a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql">Spring for GraphQL</a> is <i>another</i> higher-level
library for working with GraphQL in Java with Spring Boot, which
began around 2023, and is also based on annotations.  It may be too
new for ThoughtWorks, but it's not too new for me.  I say <b>adopt</b>,
and read on for why.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The makers of Spring for GraphQL <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql">say</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is a joint collaboration between the GraphQL Java team and Spring
engineering&#x2026;It aims to be the foundation for all Spring, GraphQL
applications.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Translation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Spring team has a privileged collaboration with the makers of the
foundational library for GraphQL in Java, and intends to "win" in this
space.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover, the makers of Netflix DGS have much to <a href="https://netflix.github.io/dgs/spring-graphql-integration/">say</a> on the subject of
that library's relationship to Spring for GraphQL.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Soon after we open-sourced the DGS framework, we learned about
parallel efforts by the Spring team to develop a GraphQL framework for
Spring Boot. The Spring GraphQL project was in the early stages at the
time and provided a low-level of integration with graphql-java. Over
the past year, however, Spring GraphQL has matured and is mostly at
feature parity with the DGS Framework. We now have 2 competing
frameworks that solve the same problems for our users.
</p>

<p>
Today, new users must choose between the DGS Framework or Spring
GraphQL, thus missing out on features available in one framework but
not the other. This is not an ideal situation for the GraphQL Java
community.
</p>

<p>
For the maintainers of DGS and Spring GraphQL, it would be far more
effective to collaborate on features and improvements instead of
having to solve the same problem independently. Finally, a unified
community would provide us with better channels for feedback.
</p>

<p>
The DGS framework is widely used and plays a vital role in the
architecture of many companies, including Netflix. Moving away from
the framework in favor of Spring-GraphQL would be a costly migration
without any real benefits.
</p>

<p>
From a Spring Framework perspective, it makes sense to have an
out-of-the-box GraphQL offering, just like Spring supports REST.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Translation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you're a Spring Boot shop already using DGS, go ahead and keep
using it for now.  If you're a Spring Boot shop starting afresh, you
should probably just use Spring for GraphQL.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this guide I've told you what GraphQL <i>is</i>.  I've told you what
GraphQL <i>really</i> is.  I've set the stage by giving some background on
the relevant libraries and frameworks in Java.  Now, let me show you
how to implement state-of-the-art GraphQL in Java for a real
application, and since we're starting afresh we'll take the advice
from DGS and just use Spring for GraphQL.

<h2 id="orgcd0f7b5">How exactly do I build a GraphQL API server in Java for a real application?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcd0f7b5">
<p>
Opinions are free to differ on what it even means to be a "real
application."  For the purpose of this guide, what <i>I</i> mean by "real
application" in this settings is an application that has at least
these features:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>persistence</dt><dd>Many <a href="https://www.graphql-java.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spring-boot">tutorials</a>, <a href="https://netflix.github.io/dgs/">getting-started guides</a>, and <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/reference/">overviews</a>
only address in-memory data models, stopping well short of
interacting with a database.  This guide shows you <i>some</i> ways to
cross this crucial chasm and discusses <i>some</i> of the consequences,
challenges, and trade-offs involved.  This is a vast topic so I
barely scratch the surface, but it's a start.  The primary goal is
to support <code>Query</code> operations.  A stretch goal is to support
<code>Mutation</code> operations.  <code>Subscription</code> operations are thoroughly
off-the-table for now.</dd>
<dt>flexibility</dt><dd>I wrote above that just <i>how</i> expressive, efficient,
discoverable, and simple we make our GraphQL API is technically a
choice we make, but is practically a property that emerges from other
choices we make.  I also wrote that building GraphQL API servers is
difficult for data producers.  Consequently, many data producers
cope with that difficulty by dialing way back on those other
properties of the API.  Many GraphQL API servers in the real world
are inflexible, are superficial, are shallow, and are in many ways
"GraphQL-in-name-only."  This guide shows <i>some</i> of what's involved
in going beyond the <i>status quo</i> and how that comes into tension
with other properties, like efficiency.  <b>Spoiler Alert</b>:  It isn't
pretty.</dd>
<dt>efficiency</dt><dd>In fairness, many GraphQL API servers in the real
world achieve decent efficiency, albeit at the expense of
flexibility, by essentially encoding REST API endpoints into a
shallow GraphQL schema.  The standard approach in GraphQL is the
<a href="https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/batching/">data-loader pattern</a>, but few tutorials really show how this is used
even with an in-memory data model let alone with a database.  This
guide offers one implementation of the data loader pattern to combat
the N+1 problem.  Again, we see how that comes into tension with
flexibility and simplicity.</dd>
<dt>modernity</dt><dd>Anyone writing a Java application that accesses a
database will have to make choices about <i>how</i> to access a database.
That could involve just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity">JDBC</a> and raw SQL (for a relational database)
but arguably the current industry standard is still to use an
Object-Relational Mapping (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220823105749/http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">ORM</a>) layer like <a href="https://hibernate.org/orm/">Hibernate</a>, <a href="https://www.jooq.org/">jooq</a>, or the
standard <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnbpz.html">JPA</a>.  Getting an ORM to play nice with GraphQL is a tall
order, may not be prudent, and may not even be possible.  Few if any
other guides touch this with a ten-foot-pole.  This guide at least
<del>makes an attemp</del> <i>will make an attempt with an ORM in the future!</i></dd>
</dl>

<p>
The recipe I follow in this guide for building a GraphQL API server in
Java <i>for a relational database</i> is the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Choose <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a> for the overall server framework.</li>
<li>Choose <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql">Spring for GraphQL</a> for the GraphQL-specific parts.</li>
<li>Choose <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc">Spring Data for JDBC</a> for data access in lieu of an ORM <i>for
now</i>.</li>
<li>Choose <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> over <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> because I prefer the former.  If you
choose the latter, you're on your own.</li>
<li>Choose <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> for the database.  Most of the principles should
apply for pretty much any relational database, but you've got to
start somewhere.</li>
<li>Choose <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> for orchestrating a development database
server.  There are <a href="https://testcontainers.com/">other</a> ways of bringing in a database, but again,
you've got to start somewhere.</li>
<li>Choose the <a href="https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/sample-data/chinook">Chinook</a> data model.  Naturally, you will have your own
data model, but Chinook is a good choice for illustration purposes
because it's fairly rich, has quite a few tables and relationships,
goes well beyond the ubiquitous but trivial <a href="https://todomvc.com/">To-Do</a> apps, is
available for a wide variety of databases, and is generally
well-understood.</li>
<li>Choose the <a href="https://netflix.github.io/dgs/#create-a-new-spring-boot-application">Spring Initializr</a> for bootstrapping the application.
There's so much ceremony in Java, any way to race through some of
it is welcomed.</li>
<li><a href="https://netflix.github.io/dgs/#creating-a-schema">Create</a> a GraphQL schema file.  This is a necessary step for
graphql-java, for DGS, and for Spring for GraphQL.  Weirdly, the
Spring for GraphQL overview seems to overlook this step, but the
DGS "Getting Started" guide is there to remind us.  Many "thought
leaders" will exhort you to isolate your underlying data model from
your API.  Theoretically, you could do this by having different
GraphQL types from your database tables.  Practically, this is a
source of busy-work.</li>
<li>Write Java model classes, one for every GraphQL type in the schema
file and every table in the database.  You're free to make other
choices for this data model or for any other data model, and you
can even write code or SQL views to isolate your underlying data
model from your API, but do ask how important this really is when
the number of tables/classes/types grows to the hundreds or
thousands.</li>
<li>Write Java controller classes, with one method at least for every
<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/fullstack-quickstart/04-writing-query-resolvers">root field</a>.  In practice, this is the bare minimum.  There
probably will be many more.  By the way, these methods <i>are</i> your
"resolvers".</li>
<li>Annotate every controller class with <code>@Controller</code> to tell Spring
to inject it as a Java Bean that can serve network traffic.</li>
<li>Annotate every resolver/data-fetcher method with <code>@SchemaMapping</code>
or <code>QueryMapping</code> to tell Spring for GraphQL how to execute the
parts of a GraphQL operation.</li>
<li>Implement those resolver/data-fetcher methods <i>by whatever means
necessary</i> to mediate interactions with the database.  In version
0, this will be just simple raw SQL statements.</li>
<li>Upgrade <i>some</i> of those resolver/data-fetcher methods by replacing
<code>@SchemaMapping</code> or <code>@QueryMapping</code> with <code>@BatchMapping</code>.  This
latter annotation signals to Spring for GraphQL that we want make
the execution more efficient by combating the N+1 problem, and
we're prepared to pay the price in more code in order do do it.</li>
<li>Refactor those <code>@BatchMapping</code>-annotated methods to support the
data loader pattern, by accepting (and processing) a <i>list</i> of
identifiers for related entities, rather than a single identifier
for a single related entity.</li>
<li><del>Write copious test-cases for every possible interaction.</del></li>
<li>Just use a <a href="https://github.com/EMResearch/EvoMaster">fuzz-tester</a> on the API and call it a day.</li>

That is a <i>long recipe</i> above!  Instead of going into
chapter-and-verse for every single step, in this guide I do two
things.  First, I provide a public <a href="https://github.com/dventimihasura/graphql-with-java">repository</a> with working code that
is easy to use, easy to run, easy to read, and easy to understand.  If
you feel it falls short in any of these objects <i>please do let me

Again, there are other ways to pull this off, but this is one good
way.

The Chinook files from <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/blog/postgresql-how-to-installing-the-chinook-sample-db-on-a-distributed-sql-database/">YugaByte</a> work out-of-the-box for PostgreSQL and
are a good choice.  Just make sure that there is a sub-directory
<code>initdb.d-postgres</code> and download the Chinook DDL and DML files into
that directory, taking care to give them numeric prefixes so that
they're run by the PostgreSQL initialization script in the proper
order.

<h3 id="org94aa881">Step 9: <a href="https://netflix.github.io/dgs/#creating-a-schema">Create</a> a GraphQL schema file.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org94aa881">
<p>
Maven projects have a standard directory layout, and a standard place
within that layout for resource files to be packaged into the build
artifact (a JAR file) is <code>./src/main/java/resources</code>.  Within that
directory, create a sub-directory <code>graphql</code> and deposit a
<code>schema.graphqls</code> file.  There are other ways to organize the GraphQL
schema files needed by graphql-java, DGS, and Spring for GraphQL, but
they all are rooted in <code>./src/main/java/resources</code> (for a Maven
project).
</p>

<p>
Within the <code>schema.graphqls</code> file (or its equivalent), first there
will a definition for the root <code>Query</code> object, with root-level fields
for every GraphQL type that we want in our API.  As a starting point,
there will be a root-level field under <code>Query</code> for every table, and a
corresponding <code>type</code> for every table.  For example, for <code>Query</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-graphql">type Query {
  Artist(limit: Int): [Artist]
  ArtistById(id: Int): Artist
  Album(limit: Int): [Album]
  AlbumById(id: Int): Album
  Track(limit: Int): [Track]
  TrackById(id: Int): Track
  Playlist(limit: Int): [Playlist]
  PlaylistById(id: Int): Playlist
  PlaylistTrack(limit: Int): [PlaylistTrack]
  PlaylistTrackById(id: Int): PlaylistTrack
  Genre(limit: Int): [Genre]
  GenreById(id: Int): Genre
  MediaType(limit: Int): [MediaType]
  MediaTypeById(id: Int): MediaType
  Customer(limit: Int): [Customer]
  CustoemrById(id: Int): Customer
  Employee(limit: Int): [Employee]
  EmployeeById(id: Int): Employee
  Invoice(limit: Int): [Invoice]
  InvoiceById(id: Int): Invoice
  InvoiceLine(limit: Int): [InvoiceLine]
  InvoiceLineById(id: Int): InvoiceLine
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note the parameters on these fields.  I have written it so that every
root-level field that has a <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Wrapping-Types">List</a> return type accepts one optional
<code>limit</code> parameter which accepts an <code>Int</code>.  The intention is to support
limiting the number of entries that should be returned from a
root-level field.  Note also that every root-level field that has a
<a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#ScalarTypeDefinition">Scalar</a> object return type accepts one optional <code>id</code> parameter which
also accepts an <code>Int</code>.  The intention is to support fetching a single
entry by its identifier (which happen all to be <code>integer</code> primary keys
in the Chinook data model).
</p>

<p>
Next, here is an illustration of <i>some</i> of the corresponding GraphQL
types:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-graphql">type Album {
  AlbumId  : Int
  Title    : String
  ArtistId : Int
  Artist   : Artist

}

type Artist {
  ArtistId: Int
  Name: String
  Albums: [Album]
}

type Customer {
  CustomerId   : Int
  FirstName    : String
  LastName     : String
  Company      : String
  Address      : String
  City         : String

have "getter" and "setter" property methods for the corresponding

Java Record classes just for the minimal amount of boilerplate.

<p>
These are the Spring <code>@Controller</code> classes, and within them are the
Spring for GraphQL <code>QueryMapping</code> and <code>@SchemaMapping</code>
resolver/data-fetcher methods.  These are the real workhorses of the
application, accepting input parameters, mediating interaction with
the database, validating data, implementing (or delegating) to
business logic code segments, arranging for SQL and DML statements to
be sent to the database, returning the data, processing the data, and
sending it along to the GraphQL libraries (graphql-java, DGS, Spring
for GraphQL) to package up and send off to the client.  There are <i>so</i>

<p>
There's a lot to unpack here, so let's go through it step by step.
First, I included the <code>package</code> and <code>import</code> statements in the example
because all too often, tutorials and guides that you find online elide
these details for brevity.  The problem with that, however, is that
it's <i>not compilable or runnable code</i>.  You don't know where these
symbols are coming from, what packages they're in, and what libraries
they're coming from.  Any decent editor like IntelliJ, VSCode, or even
Emacs will help sort this out for you <i>when you're writing code</i>, but
you don't have that when reading a blog article.  Moreover, there
<i>can</i> be name conflicts and ambiguities among symbols across
libraries, so even with a smart editor it can leave the reader
scratching their head.
</p>

<p>
Next, please forgive the nested inner classes.  Feel free to explode
your classes out into their own individual files as you see fit.  This
is just how I do it, largely for pedagogical purposes like this one,
to promote <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/">Locality of Behavior</a>, which is just a fancy way of saying,
"let's not make the reader have to jump through a lot of hoops to
understand the code."
</p>

<p>
Now for the meat of the code.  Aside from niggling details like "How
do I get a database connection", "How do I map data", etc., the
patterns I want you to see through the forest of code are these:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Every field in our schema file (<code>schema.graphqls</code>) which isn't a
simple scalar field (e.g., <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Boolean</code>) probably
will need a resolver/data-fetcher.</li>
<li>Every resolver is implemented with a Java method.</li>
<li>Every resolver method gets annotated with <code>@SchemaMapping</code>,
<code>@QueryMapping</code>, or <code>@BatchMapping</code> (more on that <a href="#org64c9cff">later</a>).</li>
<li>Use <code>@QueryMapping</code> when you can because it's simpler.  Use
<code>@SchemaMapping</code> when you have to (your IDE should nag you).</li>
<li>If you keep the Java method names in sync with the GraphQL field
names, it's a little less code, but don't make a federal case out
of it.  You can fix it with a <code>name</code> parameter in the annotations.</li>
<li>Unless you do something different (such as adding filtering,
sorting, and pagination), you probably will be fetching either a
single entry by its primary key, or a list of entries.  You <i>won't</i>
be fetching "child" entries; that's handled by the GraphQL
libraries and the recursive divide-and-conquer way they process
GraphQL operations.  <b>Note</b>: This has implications for performance,
efficiency, and code complexity.</li>
<li>The "something different" in the above item refers to richness that
you want to add to your GraphQL API.  Want <code>limit</code> operations?
Filter predicates?  Aggregations?  Supporting those cases will
involve more <code>ArgumentValue&lt;&gt;</code> parameters, more <code>SchemaMapping</code>
resolver methods, and more combinations thereof.  Deal with it.</li>
<li>You <i>will</i> experience the urge to be clever, to create abstractions
that dynamically respond to more and more complex combinations of
parameters, filters, and other conditions.  Congratulations:
you're on your way to building a <a href="#orgd3e9d19">general-purpose query engine</a>.</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org64c9cff">
<p>
You will quickly realize that this can lead to overly chatty
interaction with the database, sending too many small SQL statements
and impacting performance and availability.  This is the proverbial
"N+1" problem.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the N+1 problem can be illustrated by our Chinook data
model.  Suppose we have this GraphQL query.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-graphql">query {
  Artist(limit: 10) {
    ArtistId
    Album {
      AlbumId
      Track {
        TrackId
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Get up to 10 <code>Artist</code> entry.</li>
<li>For each <code>Artist</code>, get all of the related <code>Album</code> entries.</li>
<li>For each <code>Album</code>, get all of the related <code>Track</code> entries.</li>
<li>For each entry, just get its identifier field:  <code>ArtistId</code>,
<code>AlbumId</code>, <code>TrackId</code>.</li>
<li>This query is nested 2 levels below <code>Artist</code>.  Let \(~n=2~\).</li>
<li><code>Album</code> is a <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Wrapping-Types">List</a> wrapping type on <code>Artist</code>, as is <code>Track</code> is a
<a href="https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Wrapping-Types">List</a> wrapping type on <code>Album</code>.  Suppose the typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">cardinality</a> is
\(m\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
How many SQL statements will typically be involved
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>1 to fetch 10 <code>Artist</code> entries.</li>
<li>\(10*m\) to fetch the <code>Album</code> entries.</li>
<li>\(10*m^2\) to fetch the <code>Track</code> entries.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In general, we can see that the number of queries scales as \(m^n\),
which is exponential in \(n\).  Of course, observe that the amount of data
retrieved also scales as \(m^n\).  In any case, on its face, this
<i>seems</i> like an alarmingly inefficient way to go about fetching these
data.  Is there another way?
</p>

<p>
There is another way and it it is the standard answer within the
GraphQL community for combating this N+1 problem: the data loader
pattern (aka "batching").  This encompasses two ideas:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Rather than fetch the related child entities (e.g. <code>Album</code>) for a
<i>single</i> parent entity (e.g. <code>Artist</code>) using one identifier, fetch
the related entities for <i>all</i> of the parent entities in one go,
using a list of identifiers.</li>
<li>Group the resulting child entities according to their respective
parent entities (in code).</li>
<li>While we're at it, we might as well cache the entities for the
lifetime of executing the one GraphQL operation, in case a given
entity appears in more than one place in the graph.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, for some code.  Here's how this looks in our example.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-java">@BatchMapping(field = "Albums") public Map&lt;Artist, List&lt;Album&gt;&gt; // Switch to @BatchMapping
    albumsForArtist (List&lt;Artist&gt; artists) { // Take in a List of parents rather than a single parent
    return
        jdbcClient
        .sql("select * from \"Album\" where \"ArtistId\" in (:ids)") // Use a SQL "in" predicate taking a list of identifiers
        .param("ids", artists.stream().map(x -&gt; x.ArtistId()).toList()) // Fish the list of identifiers out of the list of parent objects
        .query(mapper)	// Can re-use our usual mapper
        .list()
        .stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(x -&gt; artists.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Artist::ArtistId)).get(x.ArtistId()).getFirst()));
    // ^ Java idiom for grouping child Albums according to their parent Albums
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Like before, let's unpack this.  First, we switch from either the
<code>@QueryMapping</code> or <code>@SchemaMapping</code> annotation to <code>@BatchMapping</code>, to
signal to Spring for GraphQL that we want to use the data loader
pattern.  Second, we switch from a single <code>Artist</code> parameter to a
<code>List&lt;Artist&gt;</code> parameter.  Third, we somehow have to arrange the
necessary SQL (with an <code>in</code> predicate in this case) and the
corresponding parameter (a <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> extracted from the
<code>List&lt;Album&gt;</code> parameter).  Fourth, we have somehow have to arrange for
the child entries (<code>Album</code> in this case) to get sorted to the right
parent entries (<code>Album</code> in this case).  There are many ways to do it,
and this is just one way.  The important point is that however it's
done, <i>it has to be done in Java</i>.  One last thing: note the absence
of the <code>limit</code> parameter.  Where did that go?  It turns out that
<code>InputValue&lt;T&gt;</code> is not supported by Spring for GraphQL for
<code>@BatchMapping</code>.  Oh well! 😒 In this case, it's no great loss because
arguably these <code>limit</code> parameters make little sense.  How often does
one really need a random subset of an artist's albums?  It's a more
serious issue if we had filtering and sorting, however.  Filtering and
sorting parameters are more justified, and if we had them we would
somehow have to find a way to sneak them into the data loader pattern.
Presumably, it can be done, but it will not be so easy as just
slapping a <code>@BatchMapping</code> annotation onto the method and tinkering
with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams.html">Java streams</a>.

<details id="orgf0e83cb">
<p>
This raises an important point about the "N+1 problem" that is <i>never</i>
addressed, and that neglect just serves to exaggerate the scale of the
problem in a real world setting.  <i>If</i> we have limits and/or
filtering, then we have a way of reducing the cardinality of related
child entities below \(m\) (recall that we took \(m\) to be the typical
cardinality of a child entity).  In a real world setting <i>limits or
more precisely filtering are necessary for usability</i>.  GraphQL APIs
are meant for humans, in that at the end of the day, the data are
being painted onto a screen or in some other way presented to a human
user who then has to absorb and process those data.  Humans have
severe limits in perception, cognition, and memory, for the quantity
of data we can process.  Only another machine (i.e. computers) could
possibly process a large volume of data, but if you're extracting
large volumes of data from one machine to another, then you are
building an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a> pipeline.  If you are using GraphQL for ETL then <i>you
are doing it wrong</i> and should stop immediately!
</p>

<p>
In any event, in a real world setting, with human users, both \(m\) and
\(n\) will be very small.  The number of SQL queries <i>will not</i> scale as
\(m^n\) to very large numbers.  Effectively, the N+1 problem will
inflate the number of SQL queries not by an <i>arbitrarily large
factor</i>, but by approximately a <i>constant factor</i>.  In a well-designed
application, it probably will be a constant factor well below 100.
Consider this when balancing the trade-offs in developer time, in
complexity, and in hardware scaling, when confronting the N+1 problem.

<h2 id="orgd3e9d19">Is this the <i>Only</i> way to build a GraphQL API server?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd3e9d19">
<p>
We saw that the "easy way" of building GraphQL servers is the one
typically offered in tutorials and "Getting Started" guides, and is
over tiny unrealistic in-memory data models, without a database.
</p>

<p>
We saw that the "real way" of building GraphQL servers (in Java)
described in some detail above, regardless of library or framework,
involves:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>writing schema file entries, possibly for every table</li>
<li>writing Java model classes, possibly for every table</li>
<li>writing Java resolver methods, possibly for every field in every table</li>
<li>eventually writing code to solve arbitrarily complex compositions of
input parameters</li>
<li>writing code to budget SQL operations efficiently</li>
</ul>

<p>
We also observe that GraphQL lends itself to a "recursive
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm">divide-and-conquer</a> with an accumulator approach": a GraphQL query is
recursively divided and sub-divided along type and field boundaries
into a "graph", internal nodes in the graph are processed individually
by resolvers, but the data are passed up the graph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming">dataflow</a> style,
accumulating into a JSON envelope that is returned to the user.  The
GraphQL libraries are decomposing the incoming queries into something
like an Abstract Syntax Tree (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a>), firing SQL statements for all the
internal nodes (ignoring the data loader pattern for a moment), then
re-composing the data.  And, we are its willing accomplices!
</p>

<p>
We <i>also</i> observe that building GraphQL servers according to the above
recipes leads to other outcomes:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>lots of repetition</li>
<li>lots of boilerplate code</li>
<li>bespoke servers</li>
<li>that are tied to a particular data model</li>
</ul>

<p>
Build a GraphQL server more than once according to the above recipes
and you will make these observations.  Making these observations, you
will naturally feel a powerful urge to build more sophisticated
abstractions that reduce the repetition, reduce the boilerplate,
generalize the servers, and decouple them from any particular data
model.  This is what I call the "natural way" of building a GraphQL
API, as it's a natural evolution from the trivial "easy way" of
tutorials and "Getting Started" guides, and from the cumbersome "real
way" of resolvers and even data loaders.
</p>

<p>
Building a GraphQL server with a network of nested resolvers offers
some flexibility and dynamism, and requires a lot of code.  Adding in
more flexibility and dynamism with limits, pagination, filtering, and
sorting, requires more code still. And while it may be dynamic, it
will also be very chatty with the database, as we saw.  Reducing the
chattiness necessitates composing the many fragmentary SQL statements
into fewer SQL statements which individually do more work.  That's
what the data loader pattern does: it reduces the number of SQL
statements from "a few tens" to "less than 10 but more than 1".  In
practice, that may not be a huge win and it comes at the cost of
developer time and lost dynamism, but it <i>is</i> a step down the path of
generating fewer, more sophisticated queries.  The terminus of that
path is "1": the optimal number of SQL statements (ignoring caching)
is 1.  Generate one giant SQL statement that does <i>all</i> the work of
fetching the data, teach it to generate JSON while you're at it, and
this is the best you will ever do with a GraphQL server (for a
relational database).  It will be hard work, but you can take solace
that having done it once, it need not ever be done again if you do it
right, by introspecting the database to <i>generate</i> the schema.
</p>

<p>
Do <i>that</i>, and what you will build won't be so much a "GraphQL API
server" as a "GraphQL to SQL compiler."  If that gives you pause,
consider that this is what you were already doing all along, anyway.
<del>The easy way</del>, the real way, the natural way:  they're <del>all</del> both
necessarily GraphQL to SQL compilers!  They just lie along a spectrum
of versatility, flexibility, and efficiency.  Acknowledge that
building a GraphQL to SQL compiler is what you were doing all along,
embrace that fact, and lean into it, and you may never need to build
another GraphQL server again.  What could be better than that?
</p>

<p>
One thing that could be better than building your last GraphQL server,
or your only GraphQL server, is never building a GraphQL server in the
first place.  After all, your goal wasn't to <i>build</i> a GraphQL API,
but rather to <i>have</i> a GraphQL API.  The easiest way to <i>have</i> a
GraphQL API is just to go get one.  Get one for free if you can.  Buy
one if the needs justify it.  This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)#Final_boss">final boss</a> on the journey of
GraphQL maturity.

<h2 id="orge86cd9c">How to choose "Buy" over "Buy"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge86cd9c">
<p>
You don't <i>literally</i> need to <i>buy</i> a GraphQL server.  You can, and
there can be good reasons to do so in some settings, but there are
other options.  What I really mean to address is the decision over
whether or not to <i>build</i> a GraphQL server.  In some cases, this may
be warranted, but in most cases <i>it is not</i>.
</p>

<p>
It <i>does</i> depend on the data sources involved.  If there are
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> databases or <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_derived_databases">PostgreSQL-ish</a> databases for which we want
APIs, then we are blessed with many fine choices.
</p>

<p>
First, in this case it pays to consider whether or not we truly need a
<i>GraphQL</i> API.  How do we decide if we need a GraphQL API?  Of course,
there's no right answer, but the following considerations are useful
guide.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Are your data consumers humans or machines?</dt><dd>If they're machines
<i>you DO NOT need GraphQL</i>.</dd>
<dt>Similarly, are you serving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a> use cases?</dt><dd>If you're performing ETL
<i>you DO NOT need GraphQL</i>.</dd>
<dt>Do you have primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">analytical</a> workloads?</dt><dd>If you're serving
analytical workloads <i>you DO NOT need GraphQL</i>.</dd>
<dt>Do you have a public, semi-public, or private API?</dt><dd>Well, it depends.
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Public</dt><dd><i>You MAY have GraphQL</i>.  GraphQL is a good choice for
fully public freely-available APIs because of its flexibility,
efficiency, and especially its discoverability.  You <i>will</i> have
to take steps to secure the API against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DoS</a> attacks (rate
limits, time limits, query complexity limits, throttling) but
probably not against exfiltration or tampering.  You probably won't
need query white-listing and you probably won't want to turn off
GraphQL introspection queries.  Tampering probably won't be an
issue as typically these are read-only APIs.  In any case, when
you cannot anticipate the range of queries, GraphQL is a good
choice.</dd>
<dt>Semi-public</dt><dd><i>You MAY have GraphQL</i>.  GraphQL is a good choice
for semi-public APIs, such as those secured by credentials,
subject to authorization, and open only to select customers and
partners, but still operating over the open internet.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are still a threat, though less
so, but now exfiltration and especially tampering are bigger
concerns.  Like with a public API, if you cannot anticipate the
full range of queries and other operations, GraphQL is a good
choice.</dd>
<dt>Private</dt><dd><i>You MAY NOT NEED GraphQL</i>.  This is the most
interesting case to me.  In this setting, the clients are
typically developed <i>in-house</i>.  A firm's "back-end" teams supply
APIs that are used by the same firm's "front-end" teams.  API
calls may still go over the open internet, as with a mobile app,
but they're typically "baked-in" with the app.  The range of API
calls is <i>finite</i> and <i>known in advance</i>.  In this case, there's
little need for GraphQL discoverability and even flexibility, at
least in the production environment.  You can and <i>should</i> disable
introspection queries, and you <i>should</i> consider white-listing.
At this point, however, it throws into question the <i>value</i> of a
GraphQL API.  If you know all of the operations in advance <i>you
MAY just use REST!</i></dd>
</dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>
With those considerations in mind, we return to the subject of
<i>acquiring</i> an API server over building one, and in that case which
one to acquire.  If you don't <i>need</i> a GraphQL API&#x2013;perhaps because
you have private API needs, you <i>may</i> stick with REST.  If you have
PostgreSQL or PostgreSQL-ish databases, <a href="https://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> is a very good
open-source choice.
</p>

<p>
If you <i>do</i> need a GraphQL API, and you are on PostgreSQL, then
<a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/">PostGraphile</a> is another very good open-source choice.
</p>

<p>
If you add other databases to the mix, however, the choices narrow
considerably.  <a href="https://hasura.io/opensource/">Hasura Community Edition</a> is a good choice, but
unfortunately that Open-Source version only works with PostgreSQL.  If
you are not constrained by free tools, however, <a href="https://hasura.io/enterprise/">Hasura Enterprise</a>
expands support to include Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and a
host of other databases.

What I'd like you to take away from this article are these things.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>GraphQL is a general-purpose query language, like SQL.</li>
<li>GraphQL is less powerful than SQL.</li>
<li>GraphQL is simpler than SQL.</li>
<li>But, that simplicity and diminution of power make it good for web APIs.</li>
<li>GraphQL is meant for humans.</li>
<li>Therefore, don't use GraphQL for ETL.</li>
<li>GraphQL is meant for transactional workloads.</li>
<li>Therefore, don't use GraphQL for analytical or OLAP.</li>
<li>GraphQL is useful for public and semi-public APIs.</li>
<li>Consider treating GraphQL just as a <i>development</i> tool for private APIs.</li>
<li>But then for private APIs, you might as well just substitute SQL for development.</li>
<li>If you do go with GraphQL, seriously consider <i>acquiring</i> a GraphQL
server rather than building one.</li>
<li>To acquire a GraphQL server, you're on firmest ground if you're
using PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>If you go with building a GraphQL server and you're using Java, this
guide is a good start.</li>
<li>For that case, I go well beyond the usual tutorials and "Getting
Started" guides to get you started building a real server in Java.</li>
<li>However, strap yourself in.  It's a lot of work.</li>
<li>You will write a lot of boilerplate, in schema files, model files,
controller files, and maybe ORM mapping files.</li>
<li>Consequently, resist lectures about "not exposing your data model"
because doing anything else for a large data model is a ton of work.</li>
<li><i>Probably</i> resist an pressure internal or external to use an ORM.
It probably won't help and will only hurt.</li>
<li>Adding expressivity to your GraphQL API&#x2013;the <i>raison d'etre of
GraphQL</i>&#x2013;requires a lot of work.</li>
<li><i>Nominally</i>, that expressivity also comes at the cost of
efficiency and performance.</li>
<li>That lost efficiency and performance is known as the "N+1 problem."</li>
<li>However, the N+1 problem is probably way overblown for APIs that
serve humans (see above).</li>
<li>If you're starting a GraphQL server in Java, and you're not using
Spring Boot, choose graphql-java and stop there.</li>
<li>If you're starting a GraphQL server in Java, and you ARE using
Spring Boot, prefer Spring for GraphQL over Netflix DGS.</li>
