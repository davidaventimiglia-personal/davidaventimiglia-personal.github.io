I'm a versatile, resourceful, and creative back-end engineer and technology generalist with experience in math, physics, database applications, data engineering, data science, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure. My deepest programming experience is in Java, but I am a fervent believer that the best code is the code that isn't written. Design a good data model using the power of modern data systems and their query languages, and you won't need very many algorithms.
