My name is David A. Ventimiglia.  I'm a versatile, resourceful, and
creative back-end engineer and technology generalist with experience
in math, physics, database applications, data engineering, data
science, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure. My deepest
programming experience is in Java, but I am a fervent believer that
the best code is the code that isn't written. Design a good data model
using the power of modern data systems and their query languages, and
you won't need very many algorithms.
